# web-file-analyzer
Web scraper &amp; PDF parser tool

Tool developer for internal use at a company to download pdf files from a url and parse tables into a json structure.
Hence, the tool is very specific in its current form and won't work on any pdf files as it looks for certain key:value pairs in the table to parse.
